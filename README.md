# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Bike Share

#### Tools used: Excel, SQL, Tableau.

## SCENARIO
'Cyclistic' is a bike share company with a fleet of more than 5000 bicycles thata are geotracked and locked into a network of almost 700 stations across the city. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders and customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. There have been some recent developments as the company is trying to maximise profits:

- The finance analysts concluded that annual memberships are much more profitable than casual riders.
- The director of marketing notes that casual riders already know and like the service, so there is a great opportunity to convert casual riders into annual members, instead of targetting only all-new customers.
- To design the new marketing strategy, it is necessary to understand first how casual riders and annual members use the service and provide some recommendations that 'Cyclistic' executives will be able to understand and approve.

## PROBLEM
As a data analyst who belongs to the marketing analytics team, the goal is to identify **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes, and what recommendations can be provided to convert casual riders into anualm members?**

## PREPARATION
I used historical data from a whole year (2023). The data has been taken from [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) where there is a file for each month. The data has been available by Motive International Inc under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
